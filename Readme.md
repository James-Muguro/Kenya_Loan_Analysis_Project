# Python Programming

## Description

This project, "Python Programming," is a compilation of fundamental Python programs covering various aspects of programming and problem-solving. It includes practical examples and exercises to help users, whether beginners or those looking to reinforce their Python skills, understand and apply essential programming concepts.

## Project Contents

The project encompasses several Python scripts, each designed to address specific programming concepts independently. The key components covered in this project include:

- Attendee Check-in Program: Manages event attendees, checks registration status, and assigns random seats.
- Password Generator: Generates random passwords based on user input.
- Leap Year Checker: Determines if a given year is a leap year.
- Python Quiz: Conducts a simple quiz with predefined questions and checks user answers.

## Usage

Users can run individual Python scripts to explore and practice different programming concepts. Each script is self-contained, focusing on a specific aspect of Python programming. To execute the code, ensure you have Python installed on your computer. The comments within each script provide details on any necessary installations.

## Installation

To get started with this project, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. Additionally, specific scripts may require additional packages, which can be installed using tools like pip.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into separate Python scripts, with each script dedicated to a specific programming concept. Users can explore the scripts in any order or focus on the topics that interest them the most.

## Acknowledgments

This project was created with the support of the Python community and various online resources that have contributed valuable insights and guidance for Python programming.

Happy coding and learning!
